# EmployeeManagementSystem

Written in Python tkinter and sqlite3, I created an employment inventory. This program is intended for administrators to store information on Employees. Admins can view all records, search an entry, add entry, update entry, delete an entry, and close the application.

Run:
python frontend.py
./frontend.exe
